					    <p>
							I started my journey in programming during high school, and I continue to pursue my passion for it. Until 2014, I worked on various freelance website projects. In 2014, I decided to add Android application development to my portfolio and began learning after a 100-hour in-person training.
						  </p>
						  
						  <p>
							Prior to that, I developed Android applications in my own company. After closing my company, I continued developing Android applications in my client's company. When I realized I couldn't improve myself in the new company, I decided to develop my own game.
						  </p>
						  
						  <p>
							Showing the content of my game, I joined the company I am currently working for, and since 2019, I have been working in a large and professional team on projects for major companies in Turkey.

												A word game where 2 people from anywhere in the world can instantly match and play online. The application is currently in the closed beta testing phase and not yet available on the market. The application supports 9 languages, including Turkish and English.
											  </p>
											  
											  <p>
												Android (Java) was used as the infrastructure for the application. Throughout the development, I had the opportunity to work with various technology libraries, such as Firebase for notifications, AdMob for advertisements (banner, full-screen, and rewarded ads), Analytics for data analysis, and communication with the server.
											  </p>
											  
											  <p>
												The application features Facebook and Google Login. Additionally, there are various sub-screens such as ranking, wildcard code, previous games, etc.
											  </p>
											  
											  <p>
												While developing the same application, I learned and continue to learn many things, ranging from the intricacies of implementation to the utilization of different technologies.

												After graduating from university, I immediately founded my own company without having prior experience working with a professional team. I started developing websites and mobile applications for my clients. Due to various reasons, approximately one year later, I had to close this company.
											  </p>
											  
											  <p>
												After closing my company, I joined a company where one of my clients was working.
											  </p>
											  
											  <p>
												While working at the new job, I developed a mobile application that allowed users to earn money by getting them to download other applications. The application is not currently live.
											  </p>
											  
											  <p>
												During my time at the company, the idea for the mobile application was abandoned. Meanwhile, I started working on a game for myself while also handling SEO tasks and managing the team's editors.
